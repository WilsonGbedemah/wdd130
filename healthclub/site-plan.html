      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[I am a Psychologist, I help maintain the mental health of people, especially children. My institution aims at improving the health of children with regards to their mental, emotional, and physical well-being for great growth and helps raise funds to facilitate the smooth running of health facilities for children.
        My institution puts in place many activities, and practices that aim at helping our children grow in the mental, emotional, and physical areas of their life, without putting these children in difficult situations and also helping them come out of difficult situations when they find themselves in one.
        Think of the last time you helped a child overcome a difficult situation, were you prepared for that.? Did you feel you had adequately equipped that child with the courage and skills to overcome that difficult situation.? Did it go smoothly? If not, then that is what my organization and I specialize in, we help equip these children with the skills necessary to help them overcome every situation they find themselves also providing extensive physical activities to always keep them physically and emotionally strong and fit.
