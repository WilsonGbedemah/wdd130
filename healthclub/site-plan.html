      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[I am a Psychologist, I help maintain the mental health of people, especially children. My institution aims at improving the health of children with regards to their mental, emotional, and physical well-being for great growth and helps raise funds to facilitate the smooth running of health facilities for children.
        My institution puts in place many activities, and practices that aim at helping our children grow in the mental, emotional, and physical areas of their life, without putting these children in difficult situations and also helping them come out of difficult situations when they find themselves in one.
        Think of the last time you helped a child overcome a difficult situation, were you prepared for that.? Did you feel you had adequately equipped that child with the courage and skills to overcome that difficult situation.? Did it go smoothly? If not, then that is what my organization and I specialize in, we help equip these children with the skills necessary to help them overcome every situation they find themselves also providing extensive physical activities to always keep them physically and emotionally strong and fit.

        [Where we create awareness of various health issues in children and youth and provide facilities for regular checkup
        and possible treatment of health and personal issues. We put smiles on the faces of all children and yout and help for strong physical,

        get them to open up about the many various problems they are facing which is making it very difficult for the, and as solutions these personnels try to help these children find personal
        solution in their own ways so they feel entilttles to go through what ever solution they came up with. Also as part of the exercise, these personnel give advices to children on matter 
        relating to life with reference to career choices, interest development, developing emotional health and bringing out the very best in themselves, and at the end of the day these children
        alwasy light uo with joy and feel more confident of themselves.For this reason, people come to the organisation or the webite with much emotional problems but help much help are able to find

      <h3>[Treatment of Health issues]</h3>
      <p>
        [Children are so prone to many illments wi=hich sometimes are very chronic and might even take the life of these children, We as parent smost often because of the
        the busy schedules we have at work and because we are trying everyday to provide for the needs of our family and seeing that the need for survival is increasing each day we most at times do not have the time needed 
        to saty with our children aso they can tell us of their issues in terms of illments and sometimes we brush these off as jokes. The organisation as part of its increasing desire to help young ones become the better versins of themselves
        have aquired the services of skilled medical practicioner who are there to help diagnose illness in children quicl=kly so they have the upperhand in giving out solutions to help save thge lifes of such wonderful gifts which God had entrusted 
        in our care as parent, They also hold regular discussion meetings with parent to advice and give them more insights into how to realte with their children so these children fell entittled to approach them as parents when the feel any discomfort or 
        notice strange things starting to happen in their bodies, and as parent when we get a great notice of these information what to do with them. After helping to either diagnose to identify these issues with our young one, it becomes the responsibility of the organusation to 
        provide the best medical care and treatment for these children, ranging from over the counter medicine, intensive care for these children and in very few instances surgical operations, all these are available to help these children at very affordabke and cheap rates for 
        all to be able to afford. We help save lives of the great futre generations so the world has enough people to carry on its great purpose.]

      <h3>[Sports and Fun time]</h3>
      <p>
        [To maintain the physical health of all people they enage themselves in vigorous or regular ezercise to make then fit, strong and happy and what prevents us from doing same with our children in terms of imbibbing in them the ability to cater for the physical appearance and take very great
        care of the bodys which has been given to them and with the in mind the organisation focuses on extening the physical abilities of these children in ways they can images as it has available a lot of sporting activities that children may show interest in, ranging from a wide varieties of  soccer,
        athletics, basketball, tennis, volley to the whole lot, these sporting activities are initiated first to help keep our kids fit and to hlp prevent and forseeabke even in term of weakness and to boost the immune system, the we also offer aerobics which turns out to be one of the most fun activities these young one prefer as they
        are able to burn callories while have fun with music, to say this what is the fun in sport or exercise when you cant laug through. The joy on the faces of these young youngs is just noticeable when they are in their sporting and exrcising spirits as most of these young ones prefer to exrcis and do sports
        thank be indoors. By doing these accessments we as an orgainisation are also able to help develop the talent and skill towards any of these sports which any child might show great interest in and provide qualified trainers in the resoctive field to help harness and develop the particular trait and skill which the person may
        have in that field of sports thereby creating a long chian of futre employment and career opprotunity for such an individual. We really have a lot to offer these young ones to improve their way of living and thinking.
        
        With all these siad the question now beckons what can we do to help, and the answers are just so simply that we think, we can consider the growth of our youngs ones who are our future and play a great factor in their development by donating to help the cause, after all what is there to loose?]
