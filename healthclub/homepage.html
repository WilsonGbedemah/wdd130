            <h2>Counseling</h2>
            <p>We put smiles on the faces of all children and youth and help for strong physical, mental, emotional and psychological growth.
                We help provide parent with the necessary know how on how to treat children and help them grow the way they should.
                As part of the process to secure the mental health of children we have realised that children feel more secure and open to discuss
                their issue with people they feel are their friends, and with that in mind this organisation has qualified people in the field of
                counseling who are child friendly and have the set skills to be abke to get very close to these children to get them to open up about
                the various problems they are facing which is making it very difficult for them, and as solutions these personnels try to help these 
                children find personal solution in their own ways so they feel entilttled to go through with whatever solution they come up with.
                Also as part of the exercise, these personnel give advices to children on matter relating to life with reference to career choices,
                interest development, developing emotional health and bringing out the very best in themselves, and at the end of the day these children
                alway light up with joy and feel more confident of themselves.For this reason, people come to the organisation or the webite with much
                emotional problems but help much help are able to find a level of peace with they have been yearning for, Children tend to bonbd well with
                chilfren their age and as such there is available groug therapy for kids and to be sincere they then to just play with themselves but this 
                great a very strong mental bond for this kids and they are always able to live up to what they decide because they feel comfortable with themselves.
                This liitle experience tends to help create and more self aware and confident set of young and great leaders.
