            <p>Hi everyone, my name if Felix from Ghana in Africa. I am pursing a degree
                in professional studies and i love to play video games and watch movies when
                i am less busy and not having and assignments to do, I also enjoy talking to 
                people to help them with their problems as well. I am not currently married 
                and do not have any children or grand children</p>
            <p>I currently work as a stock keeper in a warehouse and by pursuing my education
                i am making a lot of changes first to my career and to my life as well.The thing
                most about BYU-Idaho is the ability to give each person a fair chance at btter 
                education no matter who they are. I am taking this course so i could make for 
                myself a career in web design as i find it interesting and very great in our world
                today, I hope to be able to design web pages as best as i can and also to be able 
                to make a great career out of it as well.</p>
            <p>I have been a memeber of the Church since birth and have been priveleged to serve a 
                full time mission and it was amazing and great. i love every scripture but 1 Nephi 3:7
                has a very different tone for me as it gives assurance. I am a fun perosn and willing 
                with everyone so we all gain something great.</p>
